# Project Intro

The objective of the project is puerly research based to see how well our models can detect fake job postings. Diffrent supervised models and nerual networks will be evaluated with  diffrent feature extractions to measure performance. The current hypothesis is that the nerual networks will and multilayer perceptrons will outpefrom the base models.



# Project Description

Fake news has existed for a very long time, nearly the same amount of time as news began to circulate during  the Gutenberg printing press that was invented in 1439 (ICFJ, 2018). However, the  term “fake news” has no singular definition that is agreed upon. Recent progress in natural language generation has raised dual-use concerns in distinguishing real from fake posts. While applications like summarization and translation are positive, the underlying technology also might enable adversaries to generate fake posts as click bait or misguide the public. Almost 38% of adults consume news from online platforms (Mitchell, 2020). People can propagate a simple line of fake conspiracies and advertising through online platforms and manipulate the thoughts of people. Spreading fake news and click bait has become a new business in the digital world. The simple clicks  on these a digital platform can have a harmful effect for users finances, trust of doing buiness on the platform, and prone to have personal information resold.

# Data Acquisition

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction

Contains: 18 features 

18 thousand jobs posts are recorded with 800 of them being fake.The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent.
